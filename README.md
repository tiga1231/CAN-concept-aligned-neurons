# CAN - Concept Aligned Neruons for visual comparison of neural networks
A WIP document

## Getting ready for visualization

1. Generate Word Hierarchy
wordnet-2.ipynb
2. [optional] Generating attack images 
check adversarial-attack.ipynb 
3. Generating Concept-neuron alignment from CLIP-Dissect
see run_describe_neurons.sh
4. Go to
