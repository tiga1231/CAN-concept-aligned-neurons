# CAN - Concept Aligned Neurons for visual comparison of neural networks


## Getting Started
0. Setting up the environment
1. Generating data
    1. Generate Word Hierarchy
    wordnet-2.ipynb
    2. [optional] Generating attack images 
    adversarial-attack.ipynb 
    3. Generating Concept-neuron alignment from CLIP-Dissect
    see run_describe_neurons.sh
2. Starting up data server
3. Go to https://observablehq.com/@tiga1231/can-concept-aligned-neurons
